- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olga Lisenco / @olgalis
With a completed retraining in application development, I bring a wide range of skills for different tasks as an IT specialist. Solving problems gives me pleasure and is a constant motivation. I am characterised by my willingness to learn and am open to new challenges in order to continuously expand my knowledge and thus make a valuable contribution to the success of the company.
